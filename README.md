Trying to make the worlds cheapest syringe pump/linear drive

http://www.billconnelly.net/?p=176

99% of things you buy from scientific suppliers are violently overpriced. Peristaltic pumps for $2000 that only contain $50 worth of equipment. Homeothermic blankets should only cost about three fifty. But the one that has always annoyed me are syringe drivers. These are nothing more than a stepper motor, a lead screw and a bit of electronics. The budget ones tend to start at around $300, and they go up to ten times that. Iâ€™m not standing for that, and neither should you. So I wanted to make one myself.
